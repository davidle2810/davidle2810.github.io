<div style="text-align: justify">In the realm of House Price Prediction, I conducted a thorough exploration of regression techniques. The process began with comprehensive data analysis, involving the examination of patterns and relationships within the dataset. Subsequently, rigorous data cleaning and feature extraction were undertaken to enhance the quality and relevance of the input variables. Employing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a powerful optimization algorithm, I constructed a robust regression model tailored to predict house prices. The application of SGD facilitated the iterative refinement of model parameters, optimizing the algorithm's convergence and efficiency. This approach aimed to provide an accurate and reliable tool for forecasting house prices, contributing to informed decision-making in the real estate domain.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I executed a thorough preprocessing of a dataset comprising 100,000 entries. This involved meticulous handling of missing values, duplicate entries, unformatted text, and irrelevant columns to ensure data quality. Following preprocessing, I conducted a detailed analysis of the dataset, extracting meaningful insights and subsequently visualizing interesting patterns and trends. To further enhance computational efficiency and streamline the dataset, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce numeric dimensions. Subsequently, the dataset underwent BFR clustering utilizing the Mahalanobis distance metric, thereby facilitating the identification of distinct clusters and contributing to the development of a robust recommendation system for personalized user experiences on the Spotify platform.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I analysed the products and their selling, then I created the product profile. After that, I started to analyse the customers across all the stores and in each store. Finally, I use model from transformer to suggest products to customers that are similar to products they have purchased in the past.</div>

<p><a href="projects/guns.html"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&amp;logoColor=white" alt="Open PDF"></a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">I analyzed US gun data from 1977 to 1999 reveals fluctuating trends in ownership and usage. Employing hypothesis testing, the study assessed the statistical significance of these variations. A regression model was constructed to understand the relationship between a key variable and quantitative factors, with subsequent hypothesis testing on their distribution. This approach offers insights into the nuanced dynamics of gun-related phenomena during this period, providing a concise yet comprehensive analysis of the statistical landscape.</div>

<h3 id="keyword-extraction">Keyword Extraction</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify">After preprocessing the text data, I applied the TF-IDF algorithm to quantify the importance of each term within the context of individual articles and topics. Subsequently, I identified and extracted the top 5 keywords for each article, offering a concise representation of the most significant terms within the document. Additionally, the process extended to extracting the top 5 keywords for each overarching topic, facilitating a hierarchical understanding of key terms at both the article and topic levels. This methodology aimed to provide a nuanced insight into the essential elements of each news article and its broader thematic context within the BBC dataset.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I utilized semantic similarities to retrieve documents related to predefined topics and classified documents (including unrelated documents) across multiple topics by using cosine similarity. After experimenting with the AG’s news topic classification dataset containing 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples among 4 topics (world, sports, busisness, science/technology), I achieved the F1 score of 0.81.</div>
