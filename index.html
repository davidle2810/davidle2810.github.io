<div style="text-align: justify">I undertook the task of performing product recommendations on a dataset comprising 100,000 entries. Employing the A-priori algorithm, I systematically identified frequent itemsets within the dataset, revealing patterns and associations among items. Furthermore, I constructed association rules specifically for item triples, providing valuable insights into the relationships and dependencies between different products. This endeavor aimed to enhance understanding of consumer preferences and facilitate more informed decision-making in the realm of product recommendations.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I successfully preprocessed a dataset containing 7,000 records related to Electrical Vehicle Charging. After cleaning and organizing the data, I conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights. This analysis encompassed measures such as mean charging durations, distribution of charging frequencies, and correlation between charging patterns and external factors like time of day or weather conditions. By scrutinizing the dataset through a statistical lens, the goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and potential outliers that could inform strategies for optimizing charging infrastructure or enhancing user experiences in the realm of electric vehicle usage.</div>

<p><a href="projects/spotify-dataset.html"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter" alt="Open Notebook" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">I executed a thorough preprocessing of a dataset comprising 100,000 entries. This involved meticulous handling of missing values, duplicate entries, unformatted text, and irrelevant columns to ensure data quality. Following preprocessing, I conducted a detailed analysis of the dataset, extracting meaningful insights and subsequently visualizing interesting patterns and trends. To further enhance computational efficiency and streamline the dataset, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce numeric dimensions. Subsequently, the dataset underwent BFR clustering utilizing the Mahalanobis distance metric, thereby facilitating the identification of distinct clusters and contributing to the development of a robust recommendation system for personalized user experiences on the Spotify platform.</div>

<p><a href="projects/house-price-prediction.html"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter" alt="Open Notebook" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">In the realm of House Price Prediction, I conducted a thorough exploration of regression techniques. The process began with comprehensive data analysis, involving the examination of patterns and relationships within the dataset. Subsequently, rigorous data cleaning and feature extraction were undertaken to enhance the quality and relevance of the input variables. Employing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a powerful optimization algorithm, I constructed a robust regression model tailored to predict house prices. The application of SGD facilitated the iterative refinement of model parameters, optimizing the algorithm's convergence and efficiency. This approach aimed to provide an accurate and reliable tool for forecasting house prices, contributing to informed decision-making in the real estate domain.</div>

<h3 id="keyword-extraction">Keyword Extraction</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify">fter preprocessing the text data, I applied the TF-IDF algorithm to quantify the importance of each term within the context of individual articles and topics. Subsequently, I identified and extracted the top 5 keywords for each article, offering a concise representation of the most significant terms within the document. Additionally, the process extended to extracting the top 5 keywords for each overarching topic, facilitating a hierarchical understanding of key terms at both the article and topic levels. This methodology aimed to provide a nuanced insight into the essential elements of each news article and its broader thematic context within the BBC dataset.</div>

<h3 id="sentence-alignment">Sentence Alignment</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify"> I implemented a predictive approach leveraging the BERT architecture. By calculating probabilities using the softmax function, the model efficiently predicted cross-language alignments. To enhance precision, I further optimized the alignment spans through the application of Integer Linear Programming. This meticulous optimization process aimed to ensure accurate and contextually relevant alignment of sentences within the bi-text. The model, specifically designed for alignment in Korean-English datasets sourced from CNN and Yahoo, demonstrated its proficiency in aligning sentences across different languages, contributing to improved language processing and understanding in cross-lingual contexts.</div>
